## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **employee attrition trends** using the **IBM HR Analytics dataset**.  
The goal is to understand why employees leave an organization and how different factors such as **department, salary, job role, and experience** impact attrition.

## 🗂 Dataset Used

- **Dataset Name:** `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`
- **Source:** IBM HR Analytics
- Contains employee information such as:
  - Department
  - Job Role
  - Monthly Income
  - Total Working Years
  - Attrition Status

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

✔ Attrition by Department  
✔ Top Paid Job Roles  
✔ Experience vs Salary Relationship  
✔ Overall Attrition Count  

Each analysis is visualized using clean and easy-to-understand graphs.
